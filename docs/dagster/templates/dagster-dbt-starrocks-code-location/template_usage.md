# Template usage guide (Dagster + dbt + StarRocks)

This template renders a Dagster code location that orchestrates a dbt project on StarRocks.

If you are developing the **template itself**, the template source is under:

- `tools/luban-provisioner/templates/source/luban-dagster-dbt-starrocks-code-location-source-template/`

## What the template includes

- dbt models (`dbt_project/`) that build `dwd/*` and `dws/*`
- a Dagster code location (`src/<package_name>/`) that loads dbt assets
- an ODS observation loop (observable source assets + a schedule)
- declarative automation (automation condition sensor + a dbt translator)

Notes:

- On startup, Dagster ensures `dbt_project/target/manifest.json` exists by running `dbt deps` + `dbt parse` if needed. Control this via `LUBAN_DBT_PREPARE_ON_LOAD` (defaults to `1`).
- The default daily partitions start date is controlled by `DAGSTER_DAILY_PARTITIONS_START_DATE`.
- The dbt models in this template expect to run in Dagster partitioned mode and will fail fast at execution time if required dbt vars are missing.
- For partitioned runs, Dagster passes dbt variables `min_date`/`max_date` and `min_datetime`/`max_datetime` based on the partition time window.
- In this template, the dbt tag `daily` means "Dagster orchestration partitioning" (processing slices / rebuild scope). It does not imply StarRocks physical table partitioning.

## How automation works

The template uses **observable source assets** to detect changes in ODS tables, and **automation conditions** to trigger downstream dbt models.

### 1) Observe ODS tables (data version)

Key pieces:

- ODS observation config: `dbt_project/models/dwd/sources.yml` (`meta.luban.observe`)
- ODS observable sources wiring: `src/<package_name>/assets/sources/*`
- Observation job/schedule: `src/<package_name>/jobs/sources/*` and `src/<package_name>/schedules/sources/*`

The observable source assets compute a `DataVersion` by querying StarRocks:

```sql
select max(<watermark_column>) from <ods_db>.<table>
```

When that value changes, Dagster records a new observation event for the source asset.

### 2) Trigger DWD dbt models

Key pieces:

- dbt asset loading: `src/<package_name>/assets/dbt/*`

The dbt translator assigns `AutomationCondition.eager()` to selected dbt models under the `dwd/` folder.
When Dagster detects the upstream ODS source asset has a newer data version, the automation sensor can request a run to materialize the affected downstream assets.

The template also assigns `AutomationCondition.eager()` to DWS dimension models (models under `dws/` tagged `dim`).
This enables dimension refresh (for example `dws.dim_customer`) when upstream inputs (for example `dwd.customers`) change.

For daily fact models under `dws/` (tagged `daily`), this template can use partition-change propagation to trigger downstream fact partitions after upstream partitions materialize.

### 3) Partition-change (late arrivals)

Conceptually, partition-aware late arrivals are handled as two separate steps:

- **Detector** (source-driven): finds impacted partition keys and requests upstream partition runs (example: `orders`).
- **Propagator** (event-driven): listens for upstream materialization events and requests downstream partition runs (example: daily facts).

This keeps ordering correct: detectors request upstream work; successful upstream materializations produce events; propagators react to those events.

You can change this behavior via `LUBAN_PARTITION_CHANGE_PROPAGATOR_MODE`:

- `sensor` (default): downstream partitions are triggered after upstream partitions materialize
- `eager`: rely on automation conditions instead of propagation sensors

## Configuration

Most orchestration configuration is declared in dbt and discovered from `manifest.json`.
