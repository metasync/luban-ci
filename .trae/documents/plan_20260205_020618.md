I will rollback the global workflow restriction patch.

### **Rollback Plan**

1.  **Revert ConfigMap Patch**: I will create a rollback patch to remove the `templateReferencing: Strict` setting from the `argo-workflows-workflow-controller-configmap`.
2.  **Clean Up**: I will delete the `manifests/config/global-workflow-restrictions.yaml` file.
3.  **Update Makefile**: I will remove the patching step from the `pipeline-deploy` target in the `Makefile`.
4.  **Verify**: I will apply the rollback and verify the ConfigMap is clean.

This will restore the default behavior where inline templates are allowed.

Shall I proceed with this rollback?
